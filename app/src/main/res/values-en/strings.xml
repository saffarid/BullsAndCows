        The game asks for a number consisting of four different digits.
        The player\'s task is to determine that number.
        With each turn the possibility of calculating the number increases.
        The result of each move is judged by the number of bulls and cows.
        If the number and its position coincide, it is a bull.
        If the digit matches but its position does not, it is a cow.
